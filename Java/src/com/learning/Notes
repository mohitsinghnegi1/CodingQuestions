Java 1.8
-> Lambda
-> Stream APIs
-> Default & Static method in interface

Interfaces
-> Default method (Java 1.8)
-> Static Method (Java 1.8) , can be called like Interface.StaticMethod
-> Due to default method, can lead to diamond problem (same method in implemented interfaces) , to avoid must override
    default interface method
-> Class precedence > Interface precedence , so if a extended class and implemented interface have same method then
    class method will be called
-> We can not create default method of Object class

Stream API
-> 2 type stream , parallelStream()  (multiple core )
-> stream functions two type : intermediate (filter map) , termination (findFirst.orElse(), reduce(0, (x,y)->x+y))
-> uses internal iteration instead of external iteration


Predicate
-> take 1 vale return boolean [rem using filter]

Consumer
-> take value returns nothing
