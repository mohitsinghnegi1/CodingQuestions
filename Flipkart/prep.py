I was asked to introduce myself, what I like the most about my current job, what all are the projects I worked on and how, why e-commerce.





Asked me about the roles in previous org.
Explain a very high level architecture of the things I work on.
Choice of language/framework and reasons.
Choice of DB (SQL / NoSQL) and why. (Deep Discussion)
Caching Concepts with deep Discussion.
Discussion on Projects.
Situation when I proved myself more towards customer oriented.
Situation when I had disagreements with team and how did I handle.
Situation when I went out of the way to do something.
Greatest Achievement till now for me.
How to handle a situation when customer requirements are misaligned with business demands.
Steps you take to show up team work.





1) A little in depth discussion on previous projects. scalabilities, RPS of service you’ve developed, previous team dynamics (how many member team?, what responsibilities you took up? etc)

2) Challenging project that you have done, explain it.

3) Team conflict and team management. Any conflicts previously, how did you resolve those etc. Any conflicts with manager?

4) What is the recent most thing you’ve learnt and got excited about?

5) Why Flipkart? what are you looking for? What excites you the most?

6) What are you strengths and weaknesses? (Technically). Are you doing anything to improve weaknesses?

And a lot of other questions on similar lines, mostly related to the work, personality, handling situations etc

This is more of a cultural fit round.

Tips :
1. You should be able to talk qualitatively at length about the work you’ve done in the past.

2. Most of the times, context gets missed when you start explaining previous projects (or problems you have solved previously). In those cases, first define the problem briefly, if possible try to map it to a generic domain, then start explaining how you approached, how much time took and what impact it made etc.


In depth discussion on projects that I am currently doing.
Why flipkart ?
If you want to suggest a new feature for flipkart, what would it be?
Some behavioral questions.
He also asked me how is the interview process in flipkart and if I had any suggestions to improve the interview process.
