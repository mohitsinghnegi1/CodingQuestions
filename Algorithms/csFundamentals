1. Momory management in python : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arxWaw-E8QQ
-> every thing is object in python -> type(x) -> <class 'int'>
-> x = 5  and then y = x both x and y refer to same memory location -> you can verify it using id(x)==id(y)
-> python optimise the memory if an object is already created with same value then z = 5 x and z will refer to same id
-> python is dynamically typed language -> YOU CAN REASSIGN A VARIABLE TO different object hence change the reference
-> Inside Ram there are two type of memory stack , heap where stack stores the fucntion and reference variables and heap stores the
objects
-> In Ram some memory is being allocated to process , os, application , share memory
-> python interpretator keeps track of object and the number of reference mapping
-> whenever reference count becomes 0 python runs a garbage collector that removes the deadObject the algorithm is known as Reference counting
-> weakref.ref(object) does not increment the the reference count
-> stack frames are createed in stack memory and are distroyed as soon as the function returns  

Is python an interpretator language

Python is an object oriented programming language like Java
How is DFS and BFS different and what are the tradeoffs?
DFS uses Stack to find the shortest path. BFS is better when target is closer to Source. DFS is better when target is far from source. As BFS 
considers all neighbour so it is not suitable for decision tree used in puzzle games.

What is Thrashing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyWaK8pbN6A
- Thus a high degree of multiprogramming and lack of frames are two main causes of thrashing in the Operating system.

What is Belady’s Anomaly?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR1uhp--COc
- In computer storage, Bélády's anomaly is the phenomenon in which increasing the number of page frames results in an increase in the number of page faults for certain memory access patterns.
- This phenomenon is commonly experienced when using the first-in first-out page replacement algorithm.

What is a deadlock?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWFH6PLOIEI

4 necessary conditions of deadlock
1. mutual exclusion
2. no premetion
3. hold and wait 
4. circular wait
