# Paging / Virtual Memory
# CPU Scheduling Algorithm
# Deadlock / Semaphore / Critical Section
# Working of OSI Layers(CN)
# What happens if I type ‘google.com’ as URL. Explain the whole process.

#  ACID properties in DBMS
# Difference between HashMap and HashTable.
# What is Concurrent HashMap
# Difference Between Collections and Set.
# What is Constructor? It’s use case with an example.
# Explain Polymorphism with its Types with an Example.
# Difference Between Call by Value and Call By Reference. Give Example. Which we have to use and when?. I gave an example similar to Reader-Writer Problem. He simplifies it by making a master process that can update a variable. 5 slave processes can only read it. Slaves can execute concurrently, but when a master is writing, slaves can’t access the variable and vice versa. Which processes can use call by value and which can use call by reference. Explain. I was able to properly explain it and he seemed satisfied.
# A Situational Based Question – Have you ever tried moving out of your comfort zone?? When and how it impacted Business and your life.
#  OSI model vs TCP/IP model

#  Discussed about deadlocks
# 1. How are recursion and iteration handled by the compiler.
# 2. How differently are a linked list and array stored in memory.
# 3. Difference between multiprocessing and multithreading.
# 4. All normal forms in DBMS.
# What is process?
# Difference between process and thread?
# What is thrashing?
# What is normalization in database?
# What is the best normal form?
# What are procedures in database?
# What are indexing?
# Tell me how you learn a new technology?
# Time when you didn’t meet a deadline?
# Tell me a time you took some on some risk?

import collections
a = Solution()

# OrderedDict :  When you iterate over an OrderedDict object, items are traversed in the original order .
# If you update the value of an existing key, then the order remains unchanged.
# delete item from the end if not passed it will by default pop from the begining like a queue
- methods: popitem(last=True)  # i is small
- method: move_to_end(key, last=True)
# TIme complexity O(1)
# initializing deque
de = collections.deque([1, 2, 3])
de.append(4)
de.appendleft(6)
de.pop()
de.popleft()

# Time complexity of deque
# as deque provides an O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations as compared to list which provides O(n) time complexity.
# append() :- This function is used to insert the value in its argument to the right end of deque.
# appendleft() :- This function is used to insert the value in its argument to the left end of deque.
# pop() :- This function is used to delete an argument from the right end of deque.
# popleft() :- This function is used to delete an argument from the left end of deque.
#  rotate() :- This function rotates the deque by the number specified in arguments. If the number specified is negative, rotation occurs to left. Else rotation is to right.
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deque-in-python/
# to delete an eleemnt in the middle use del dequeu[index] or deq.remove(item)  time complexity is O(n)


TODO: Just seen

# - sort the Array , fix first use j as i+1  and k as n-1  use while(j<k) and see if condition matches using two pointer
