- In my last job, our CEO gave me a chance to interview and hire entry-level people for our team. I chose to hire someone who
seemed to have a lot of potential but also had some “red flags” or things that worried me. It ended up being a big mistake.
They had a poor attitude and dragged the team down until my CEO had to fire them. I learned to be more careful
and not rush my decisions and to speak with others on my team who have more experience if I’m unsure of something.
    I also realized how important each hiring decision is, which made me a better manager in the last few years of my career.
    Since then, I’ve hired eight new people and never had a bad experience like this again. But it was a great lesson to learn
    early in my career.
# The time when measuring customer experience -- user feedback
# The time when you got bad feedback from your manager -- about mail of work done 
# The time when you help a teammate -- new joiner Shaurya, Guru, Surbhi in leadsquared
# The time when you innovate something -- voting systerm , at the end we lost but we learned a lot of things
# The time when you pushing your idea -- base template
# The time when your idea was rejected
# Time when you went above and beyond your job responsibilities? -- Testing, helping people ouside of the team , debugging and finding bugs , participated in testing and helping frontend team to fix bugs
# Received negative feedback from manager and how you responded?
# Time when you failed to meet your commitment? -- regural problem solving
# Tell me about a time when you innovated and exceeded the expectation? -- portal that i creater with least possible time
# Time when you went above and beyond your job responsibilities?
# Why Amazon, Why leaving current organization in 6 months, What do you bring to the table? -- i am not bound to only my job responsibility , i am open to any task which require creative thinking

# Failed to meet the deadlines
"""n college I had two essays due within a couple days of each other. I mentally switched the due dates for them in my head,
 so while I submitted one early, the other one was submitted a day late. It was a silly mistake on my end. I talked to the 
 professor about the situation, and while I was marked down a few points, I still managed to get a "B" on the assignment. 
 The professor recommended that I start keeping track of all assignments in detail in either a journal or on my phone so 
 that something like this would not happen again. I maintained such records throughout 
the rest of my academic career and never submitted something late again, and that habit has since come in handy in the workforce.

# Example Answers to “Tell Me a Time When You Failed”
"""ans :I was managing a project for one of our biggest clients in my previous company, and I was so eager to please them that
I told them we could finish the project within 2 weeks. I thought this was doable, but it ended up taking three weeks and
they were not happy. Looking back, I realized I should have been more conservative in my estimate to the client. I realized
 that a client isn’t going to be upset if you’re clear about the timeline in advance, but they are going to be disappointed
if you promise something and then don’t deliver. So I took this experience and used it to become much better at managing
the expectations of clients during projects I oversee. For example, on the next project with a different client,
I told them it’d take four weeks and we finished in three. They were very happy about this

"""
Honestly, I had the opportunity to work with the most amazing team and colleagues possible.
Not only did they treat me like an equal despite being a fresher, but they also helped me learn and guided me whenever I required a little help.
But after working there for 3 years now, I am looking forward to a fresh set of challenges and the job profile offered by you seems perfect.
It would help me to push my limits and get out of my comfort zone and I am sure I will be able to add value to the team as well.

# OrderedDict :  When you iterate over an OrderedDict object, items are traversed in the original order .
# If you update the value of an existing key, then the order remains unchanged.
# delete item from the end if not passed it will by default pop from the begining like a queue

# TIme complexity O(1)
# initializing deque
de = collections.deque([1, 2, 3])
de.append(4)
de.appendleft(6)
de.pop()
de.popleft()

# Time complexity of deque
# as deque provides an O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations as compared to list which provides O(n) time complexity.
# append() :- This function is used to insert the value in its argument to the right end of deque.
# appendleft() :- This function is used to insert the value in its argument to the left end of deque.
# pop() :- This function is used to delete an argument from the right end of deque.
# popleft() :- This function is used to delete an argument from the left end of deque.
#  rotate() :- This function rotates the deque by the number specified in arguments. If the number specified is negative, rotation occurs to left. Else rotation is to right.

# to delete an eleemnt in the middle use del dequeu[index] or deq.remove(item)  time complexity is O(n)

HR:
Why Amazon?

# - 1. Tier 3 college, aspiration to get into Amazon, and be on the top don't want to be an average person,last time i gave interview
# but unfortunately i was not able to clear it, since then i was practicing deaily coding questions, improving the mistaks that i did last time
# - 2. Amazon is full of talented people, and I want to improve my skills and get knowlege from them, and wanted to work
# in a large scaled project which can impect many life, I wanted to understand their approach of solving problems and be a part of
# end to end lifecycle of large scaled projects at amazon


Which was the most difficult interview round and why?
Did you solve all the questions in all the rounds?
Given the fact that your current company is also good, why are switching the company at such an early stage of your career? (Reason for asking this was because it had only been two months since I had started my first job)
What were the mistakes that you have committed in your current job and what did you learn from it?
